# CSPB4830 Portfolio
When I signed up for this course, I did not realize that the major emphasis was going to be group collaboration. I found this aspect to be fairly difficult to achieve given the
online environment we are learning in. I feel like I would have enjoy this learning method much better in an in person environment. As such, I did not have much in terms of contributions during the first half of the class, much of which I regret now. I never did post my own takes or approaches to the assignments but tried to show appreciation and my own takeaways from what other people posted. I tried to add some helpful feedback or questions that might help move the idea forward. Here are some examples of what I tried to contribute:
