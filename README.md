# CSPB4830 Portfolio
When I signed up for this course, I did not realize that the major emphasis was going to be group collaboration. I found this aspect to be fairly difficult to achieve given the
online environment we are learning in and therefore my portfolio of contributions is not as robust as I would like. I feel like I would have enjoyed this learning method much better in an in person environment. As such, I did not have much in terms of contributions during the first half of the class, much of which I regret now. In the beginning a couple students tried to create a system where we each took on a seperate problem to complete and post, but there was a struggle with scheduling that made it difficult to post them in a timely manner and it eventually fizzled out. I never did post my own takes or approaches to the assignments as there were others that had shared their work long before I had a chance to start the assignments. Instead, I tried to show appreciation for what others had contributed and add my own takeaways from what other people posted. I tried to add some helpful feedback or questions that might help move the idea forward. Here are just a couple examples of what I tried to contribute:

When it comes to the assignments, there were times I took what others had posted and tried to add my own influence or ideas to expand on what someone else did. There were some assignments I feel I did well with and have attatched them to this repository in the Assignments folder.
